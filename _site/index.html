    <p>Just the other day I was on a phone interview when I was asked to explain the benefits of idempotency. At first, this term bewildered me, but after asking the interviewer to elaborate, I had a good idea as to what he was referring to. Nevertheless, after the interview I researched the term to get a better understanding of what idempotency is and why it’s useful when constructing RESTful APIs. This is what I learned.</p>

    <!-- <p>Just the other day I was on a phone interview when I was asked to explain the benefits of idempotency. At first, this term bewildered me, but after asking the interviewer to elaborate, I had a good idea as to what he was referring to. Nevertheless, after the interview I researched the term to get a better understanding of what idempotency is and why it’s useful when constructing RESTful APIs. This is what I learned.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be nice if you never lost your wifi connection and were always able to connect to the internet? I think we can all agree that it would, but we aren’t quite technologically there yet. We still lose our wifi connection, our requests may not reach the server, our responses may not reach the client, etc. Since the internet is susceptible to an unreliable connection, we want to make our APIs as robust and reliable as possible.</p>

<p>Continuing on what I said above, there are a few ways a network could lose it’s connection:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The initial request from the client to the server could fail.</li>
  <li>A call could fail while the server is processing the request.</li>
  <li>The request could get processed, but the response from the server to the client could fail.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, say you’re making a GET request to a SHOW action but the request never connects to the server. In this scenario, the request would simply get resent to the server. Since there’s a chance this request can get called more than once, we want to design our actions so that we can rest assured knowing that the same result will be returned no matter how many times the method is called, which is essentially what idempotency is.<strong> An idempotent method returns the same result, regardless if you call the method once or if you call it 100 times. </strong> Therefore, in an idempotent SHOW action, when the initial request fails, the request would get resent and the SHOW action would return the same result as if the initial call was processed successfully.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an idempotent UPDATE action to illustrate what would happen if a request would fail while the server is fulfilling the operation. The UPDATE action is responsible for updating a record in the database with the parameters that are sent to the action. If a request to the UPDATE action failed either before or after the record was updated, the request would be resent to the action where it would proceed to run normally. You don’t have to be concerned with any adverse side effects because if the record is updated once or updated five times, it’s still going to update the record with the same parameters that it was passed.</p>

<p>Finally, lets take a look at the CREATE action, which isn’t considered idempotent, and discuss what we can do to ensure this method is robust and reliable. Typically, you’ll want the CREATE method to be processed once and only once to prevent adding multiple records to the database; or, if you’re endpoint is charging your customers money, charging your customers multiple times. To prevent these unwanted side effects, we can rely on <i>idempotentcy keys</i> which is a unique ID that’s generated and sent along with the request from the client to the server. Now, on the server side, you can read the idempotentcy keys ID and determine what type of logic to perform.</p>

<p>If the request failed before it was processed, a second request would be sent and the action would proceed to be processed as normal. If the request is successfully processed, the result is cached and the response is sent back to the client. In the event that the client doesn’t receive the response, the CREATE action would receive the request again, read the idempotency key, know that the request was already processed, and return the cached result.</p>

<p>Any API should be concerned with minimizing adverse side effects and uncertainty and by implementing idempotent methods in your controllers, you do just that.</p>

    <!-- <p>Ever wonder what a hosting service is doing being the scenes that allows your website to be viewed in the browser? If this question perplexes you, as it did me, read on.</p>

<p>You just spent the last month building an awesome app and now you want to show it off to the world. Before you do anything, you’ll need to obtain a domain name so users are able to visit your website. Owning a domain name is like owning an incredibly small piece of the internet, and with ownership usually comes a price tag. Buying your own custom domain name is going to cost you around $10 to $40. However, there’s an alternative solution: you can use a free domain name that’s often provided by the hosting service. Heroku, for one, provides free domain names but requires the url to be formatted like so: <code class="highlighter-rouge">[name of app].herokuapp.com</code>.</p>

<p>Underneath a domain name is just an IP address that identifies a specific computer. However, instead of inputting your IP address (ex: 90.47.136.226) into the address bar, we use domain names like www.github.com because who wants to write, much less remember, a 10 digit number?</p>

<p>When a user inputs a domain name into the address bar, how does the browser know what to show? This is where Domain Name System (DNS) or nameservers come in. The concept of DNS is pretty straightforward: DNS is responsible for routing your domain name to the correct server that is hosting your website. Therefore, whenever a user visits your domain name, it will ping the server that is correlated to that  name (or IP address) and load it’s data.</p>

<p>Now that we have our domain name and the DNS is correctly routing visitors to our website, the last step (as you probably guessed) is hosting our website on a web hosting server. A web hosting server stores all of the HTML files, pictures, videos and other documents that your website is made up of. In order for these files to be displayed when a user visits them, they need to be stored in a folder on a computer that is connected to the internet. That is exactly what a web hosting service provides – a place to “serve” your website files.</p>

<p>Simple as that. Those are the three steps that must be taken in order to successfully host your website on the web.</p>

    <p>When you’re using AngularJS, just like in most other computer languages, you’ll most likely want to keep your controllers thin, storing most of your business logic and data elsewhere. This type of architectural design is referred to as “Separation of Concerns” and maintains that you split your applications tasks into different sections, where each section is responsible for a particular task. In Angular, this can be achieved through services. Two of the most popular types of services in Angular are factories and services.</p>

    <!-- <p>When you’re using AngularJS, just like in most other computer languages, you’ll most likely want to keep your controllers thin, storing most of your business logic and data elsewhere. This type of architectural design is referred to as “Separation of Concerns” and maintains that you split your applications tasks into different sections, where each section is responsible for a particular task. In Angular, this can be achieved through services. Two of the most popular types of services in Angular are factories and services.</p>

<p>Although factories and services share many similarities, there is a key difference between them: you instantiate a factory as an object, add properties to the object, and return the object, whereas you create a new instance of a service (with the <code>new</code> keyword), add properties to <code>this</code>, and return <code>this</code>. Therefore, you can achieve the same things in a factory as you can in a service but since a factory is an object, it is much more flexible.</p>

<p>To further clarify this distinction, let’s look at an example from an app that I’m currently working on that calculates a user’s daily return on investment for their stock portfolio. For demonstrating purposes, I’ll make a call to the backend API to retrieve all of the stocks that are held in a user’s portfolio.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">service</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'StockService'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">$http</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">setStocks</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">$http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'api/v1/stocks'</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">});</span>

<span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">factory</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'StockFactory'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">$http</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="na">setStocks</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">$http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'api/v1/stocks'</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">});</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The above example shows how to receive a user’s stocks in both a service and a factory. Looks pretty similar right? They may be performing the same functionality but the architecture that make up these services are quite different.</p>

<p>A service is viewed as a constructor function and upon instantiation, implicitly creates an empty object and assigns it to the variable <code>this</code>. <code>this</code> is also automatically returned to you.</p>

<p>A factory differs from a service in that a factory is just called, and whatever is returned from the factory is the value of that service. As a result, factories give programmers more freedom to manipulate the data according to their needs before they return it.</p>

<p>In addition, factories enable the programmer to instantiate a new object and assign it the appropriate data. For example, let’s say we want to create a new stock object of Apple’s stock containing only the stock symbol (AAPL) and the price. Here is how we could implement this using a factory:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">factory</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Stock'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">$http</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">symbol</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">price</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">{</span>
          <span class="na">symbol</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">symbol</span><span class="p">,</span>
          <span class="na">price</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">price</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">});</span></code></pre></div>

<p>In our <code>StockController</code>, we can create a stock object like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">angular</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">module</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"app"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[]);</span>
<span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">controller</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'StockController'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">Stock</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">stock</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Stock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'AAPL'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'106.10'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">});</span></code></pre></div>

<p>As a result, our <code>stock</code> variable would be assigned <code>{symbol: "AAPL", price: "106.10"}</code>.</p>

<p>In short, factories and services have very similar functionality but have a key distinguishable difference. That being said, I’ll leave you with a quote by <i>Pawel Kozlowski</i> from his book “Mastering Web Application Development with AngularJS”: “The factory method is the most common way of getting objects into AngularJS dependency injection system. It is very flexible and can contain sophisticated creation logic. Since factories are regular functions, we can also take advantage of a new lexical scope to simulate “private” variables. This is very useful as we can hide implementation details of a given service.”</p>

    <!-- <p>The long awaited day has come and you finally graduated from a coding bootcamp. There is only one obstacle in your way from landing your dream job as a Web Developer – the technical interview. To prepare, you head to Wikipedia and start looking up the most prominent sorting algorithms. It’s here where you’re introduced to Big O notation and runtime complexities such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">O(n)</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">O(n^2)</code>.

If you can relate, or you just want to brush up on what exactly <code class="highlighter-rouge">O(n log(n))</code> means, then this blog post is for you.</p>

<p>First, let’s begin with understanding exactly what Big O notation is and why it’s so useful. <strong>Big O notation is the measurement we use to gauge the runtime or complexity of an algorithm as the input gets arbitrarily large.</strong></p>

<p>Computer scientists agreed that measuring the exact runtime of an algorithm was an inadequate way to test its efficiency since the same algorithm could run faster on one computer opposed to another equally capable computer because of external variables (such as containing a faster processor). Therefore, they concluded to gauge an algorithm not by how long it takes to run, but by how much the runtime grows as the input gets larger.</p>

<p>For example, a simple iteration through an array of <i>n</i> items to find the largest value would be considered <code class="highlighter-rouge">O(n)</code>, or linear time, since you have to iterate through every item at least once to see if it is the largest digit. An implementation of this in Ruby would be:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">linear_time</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">digits</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">max</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">digits</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">first</span>
    <span class="n">digits</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">digit</span><span class="o">|</span>
        <span class="n">max</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">digit</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">digit</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">max</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Demonstrating <code class="highlighter-rouge">O(n^2)</code> is a little more complex. Let’s say we want to print out all the digits between 1 and 100 that are equally divisible by the numbers in an array. This is how it would look look in Ruby:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">quadratic_time</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">divisors</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">range_of_digits</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">divisors</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">divisor</span><span class="o">|</span>
        <span class="n">range_of_digits</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">digit</span><span class="o">|</span>
            <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">digit</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">digit</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">divisor</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
        <span class="k">end</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p><small>*Not the most efficient solution</small></p>

<p>Here, we’re nesting two loops: an outer and inner loop. First, the outer loop must iterate over the length of the array. Then, for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop must iterate each item in it’s array, finally giving us a runtime of <code class="highlighter-rouge">O(n^2)</code> or quadratic time.</p>

<p>After a brief explanation of linear and quadratic, let’s now try to tackle the meaning behind <code class="highlighter-rouge">O(n log(n))</code>. The first part of the complexity, <code class="highlighter-rouge">O(n)</code>, should look familiar – we’re iterating over the length of the array, touching each item once.</p>

<p>The second part of the complexity, <code class="highlighter-rouge">log(n)</code>, may look a little cryptic if you’ve never encountered it before. Essentially, this asks how many times do we have to divide <i>n</i> in half to convert all the items in <i>n</i> to equal subarrays of 1? To better explain this complexity, I’ll walkthrough how to implement mergesort, a popular algorithm that has a complexity of <code class="highlighter-rouge">O(n log(n))</code>. (Other common algorithms that have this complexity are heapsort, timesort and, quicksort.)</p>

<p>The basic premise of mergesort comes down to these three steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Divide the array in half</li>
    <li>Sort the divided array</li>
    <li>Merge the sorted arrays</li>
</ul>

<p>To sort the divided array, mergesort reduces each element in the array into a subarray of 1 by using a common computer science function called recursion. Let’s say we want to sort the following array of integers from 1-8: <code class="highlighter-rouge">[8, 2, 4, 7, 3, 1, 6, 5]</code>. Mergesort believes in reducing this array of eight elements into eight individual subarrays by repeatedly dividing itself in half until each element is its own subarray.</p>

<p>Following our example, the array is first cut in half to equal <code class="highlighter-rouge">[8, 2, 4, 7]</code>. Then, mergesort is recursively called (since the array’s length is larger than 1) and cut in half again to equal <code class="highlighter-rouge">[8, 2]</code>. This process continues until we’re left with <code class="highlighter-rouge">[8]</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">[2]</code>, the first two elements of the array. Now that there’s only two elements, we can compare one to the other and begin sorting our array. While implementing mergesort, you usually split up the array into the left and right half. Here, <code class="highlighter-rouge">[8]</code> would be declared the left portion and <code class="highlighter-rouge">[2]</code> the right. So, the first pair of our sorted array would be <code class="highlighter-rouge">[2, 8]</code> since <code class="highlighter-rouge">8</code> is less than <code class="highlighter-rouge">2</code>. Next, we would sort <code class="highlighter-rouge">[4, 7]</code>, which just so happens to be sorted. Finally, we would merge the first two pairs into <code class="highlighter-rouge">[2, 4, 7, 8]</code>, giving us the sorted left portion of our unsorted array. This process is completed on the right half of the array, and then the left and right portions are merged together. You can see a full implementation of mergesort in Ruby below:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">merge_sort</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arr</span><span class="p">)</span>

        <span class="n">merge</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">left</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">right</span><span class="p">)</span>

        <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">left</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">first</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">merge</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">left</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">.</span><span class="n">left</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">length</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">right</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">else</span>
        <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">right</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">first</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">merge</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">left</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">right</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">.</span><span class="n">right</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">length</span><span class="p">])</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>As stated earlier, mergesort’s complexity is <code class="highlighter-rouge">O(n log(n))</code>. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">log(n)</code> is attributed to the number of times we divide the array in half until each element is converted to subarrays of 1. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">n</code> comes from the time it takes to merge the left and the right sorted halves together. <code class="highlighter-rouge">O(n log(n))</code> is such a popular complexity because it has the best worst-case runtime you can get achieve for sorting.</p>

    <p>Spotify’s API has a whole host of endpoints that allow programmers to extract data; you can access everything from artists and their top songs to information about the users themselves. One endpoint I found particularly intriguing was the <em>User’s Top Artists and Tracks</em> endpoint where (as the title implies) Spotify collects data of a users most listened to artists and tracks. This is when I got thinking - if Spotify aggregates your top artists, wouldn’t it be cool if you could view the upcoming concerts of your favorite artists in your area? In this blog post I’m going to demonstrate how I used Spotify’s API in conjunction with the BandsInTown API to output all of the nearby upcoming concerts of my favorite artists.</p>

    <!-- <p>Spotify’s API has a whole host of endpoints that allow programmers to extract data; you can access everything from artists and their top songs to information about the users themselves. One endpoint I found particularly intriguing was the <em>User’s Top Artists and Tracks</em> endpoint where (as the title implies) Spotify collects data of a users most listened to artists and tracks. This is when I got thinking - if Spotify aggregates your top artists, wouldn’t it be cool if you could view the upcoming concerts of your favorite artists in your area? In this blog post I’m going to demonstrate how I used Spotify’s API in conjunction with the BandsInTown API to output all of the nearby upcoming concerts of my favorite artists.</p>

<p>Before we get underway, let’s add the <a href="https://github.com/guilhermesad/rspotify">RSpotify</a> gem into our app to help access the Spotify API as well as the <a href="https://github.com/taf2/curb">Curb</a> gem for formatting a get request (more on <code class="highlighter-rouge">Curb</code> later). Include the following gems in your Gemfile and run <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle</code>: edit this</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'rspotify'</span>
<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'curb'</span></code></pre></div>

<p>If our end goal is to display upcoming concerts of our top artists on Spotify, our first priority is to obtain a users top artists. In order to access a users Spotify account you’ll need to obtain an access token, provided by Spotify, that gives the developer permission to receive user information. This can be accomplished by configuring the following two files. In <code class="highlighter-rouge">application.rb</code> add:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="no">RSpotify</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">authenticate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">ENV</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"SPOTIFY_CLIENT"</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="no">ENV</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"SPOTIFY_SECRET"</span><span class="p">])</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Then, in <code class="highlighter-rouge">config/initializers/omniauth.rb</code> include:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'rspotify/oauth'</span>

<span class="no">Rails</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">application</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">middleware</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">use</span> <span class="no">OmniAuth</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Builder</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">provider</span> <span class="ss">:spotify</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">ENV</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"SPOTIFY_CLIENT"</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="no">ENV</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"SPOTIFY_SECRET"</span><span class="p">],</span>
  <span class="ss">scope: </span><span class="s1">'user-read-email user-top-read'</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>By including the <code class="highlighter-rouge">user-top-read</code> scope you’re asking the user for permission to access their top artists from Spotify. If the user accepts when they are prompted at log in, you’ll be granted an access token that you will later use in another request to the Spotify API. You can request additional user information by including other scopes found <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/using-scopes/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Next, provide a link so the user can log into their Spotify account:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-erb" data-lang="erb"><span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">link_to</span> <span class="s2">"Sign in with Spotify"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"/auth/spotify"</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Now, we’ll need to create a callback so we can manipulate the data that’s returned to us from Spotify. Head to <code class="highlighter-rouge">routes.rb</code> and declare what controller and action you’ll like your callback to hit:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">get</span> <span class="s2">"/auth/spotify/callback"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">to: </span><span class="s2">"users/spotify"</span></code></pre></div>

<p>You now have access to basic user information, such as name and email address, as well as the unique access token in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">spotify</code> action of your app.</p>

<p>Once you’ve retrieved the access token you’re ready to make a subsequent request to the Spotify API for a users top artists. To facilitate formatting the endpoint I relied on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">curb</code> gem which we previously installed in our app.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">curb</code> gem offers a straightforward way to append headers in your GET request. The following code will correctly format your request to meet Spotify’s guidelines for the <em>Users Top Artist</em> endpoint:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">http</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Curl</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/top/artists?limit=25"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">http</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">headers</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'Accept'</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'application/json'</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="n">http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">headers</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'Authorization'</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Bearer </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">access_token</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">body_str</span>

<span class="no">JSON</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">parse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">http</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></div>

<p>You can request a minimum of one or a maximum of fifty artists by modifying the <code class="highlighter-rouge">limit</code> query parameter at the conclusion of the endpoint (ex: <code class="highlighter-rouge">limit=50</code>). Finally, replace <code class="highlighter-rouge">#{access_token}</code> with the actual access token, pass in the http local variable as an argument to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">JSON.parse</code> method and you’ll receive your top artists!</p>

<h2>Finding local concerts using the BandsInTown API</h2>

<p>In accordance with the BandsInTown API, if we receive upcoming concerts for a particular artist we’ll have to construct the following URL:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="s2">"http://api.bandsintown.com/artists/</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">artist_name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">/events/recommended?location=</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">location</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&amp;app_id=</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">app_id</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&amp;api_version=</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">api_version</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&amp;format=</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">format</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The BandsInTown API  artist endpoint requires the following five parameters:</p>
<ol>
  <li>artist_name: Populate the artist_name parameter with the artist you’d like to look up. Feel free to use spaces to separate words since we’ll be escaping the URL later in this tutorial. For demonstration purposes, let’s look up the artist 'Kanye West'.</li>
  <li>location: To get upcoming concerts in an area nearby your current location, insert 'use_geoip&amp;radius=50' in the location parameter. 'use_geoip' uses the ip address of your computer to find your current location. Then, set the 'radius' parameter, which is measured in miles, to however far you’d be willing to travel to see one of your favorite bands (maximum distance is 150 miles). For this post, we’ll find concerts for our most listened to artists that are within a 50 mile radius of our current location.</li>
  <li>app_id: your app_id could be anything you wish, although it’s best practice to use a word, or words, that reflect the app you’re building. For the purpose of this tutorial, the app_id will be discover-shows.</li>
  <li>version: There are two versions of the BandsInTown API: 1.0 and 2.0. We’ll use 2.0 because it’s more current.</li>
  <li>format: Finally, fill in the format parameter with 'json' so our data will be returned to us in json format.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now our url should look like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="s2">"http://api.bandsintown.com/artists/Kanye West/events/recommended?location=use_geoip&amp;radius=50&amp;app_id=discover-shows&amp;api_version=2.0&amp;format=json"</span></code></pre></div>

<p>See that space between ‘Kanye’ and ‘West’? That’s no good, and will generate an error if we submit this URL to the BandsInTown API. To prevent this, it’s as easy as passing our URL into the URI.escape method as an argument. The URI.escape method, which comes preinstalled in Ruby, will replace any whitespace characters with <code class="highlighter-rouge">%20</code>, resulting in a valid URL.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">escaped_url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">URI</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">escape</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"http://api.bandsintown.com/artists/Kanye West/events/recommended?location=use_geoip&amp;radius=50&amp;app_id=discover-shows&amp;api_version=2.0&amp;format=json"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; escaped_url = "http://api.bandsintown.com/artists/Kanye%20West/events/recommended?location=use_geoip&amp;radius=50&amp;app_id=discover-shows&amp;api_version=2.0&amp;format=json"</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Next, we’ll convert this URL into an URI object by passing it into the URI.parse method:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">uri</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">URI</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">parse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">escaped_url</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Now we’re ready to send a get request to the BandsInTown API. We can accomplish this by passing the formatted <code class="highlighter-rouge">uri</code> variable into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">get_response</code> method of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Net::HTTP</code> class:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">response</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Net</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">HTTP</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">get_response</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">uri</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">body</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Chaining <code class="highlighter-rouge">body</code> to the end of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">get_response</code> method returns the body of the response, or the data in which we are looking for. The response is a representation of Kanye West’s upcoming concerts in JSON format. All that’s left to do is parse the response!</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="no">JSON</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">parse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">response</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></div>

<p>If we were to encapsulate all of our code, do a little refactoring, and put it inside a method, we’d get:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">events</span>
  <span class="n">escaped_uri</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">URI</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">escape</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"http://api.bandsintown.com/artists/Kanye West/events/recommended?location=use_geoip&amp;radius=50&amp;app_id=discover-shows&amp;api_version=2.0&amp;format=json"</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">uri</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">URI</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">parse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">escaped_uri</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="no">JSON</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">parse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">Net</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">HTTP</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">get_response</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">uri</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">body</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>There you have it. That’s how to use the Spotify API combined with the BandsInTown API to retrieve upcoming concerts of your most listened to bands on Spotify.
