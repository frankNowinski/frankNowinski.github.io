If you asked me what an 'if' statement was back in the winter of 2015 I wouldn't have had the first inkling of what you were talking about. Not only do I now know what an 'if' statement is and how to implement one, but now I'm capable of creating an entire web application on my own. Throughout the past few months I've fervently immersed myself into learning how to code; I've done everything from enroll in open online college courses (MOOCs), read programming books, utilize online tutorials, and now I'm currently in the process of completing Flatiron School's Learn-Verified program. Included in this blog are some obstacles I've faced on my journey to becoming a Web Developer.
